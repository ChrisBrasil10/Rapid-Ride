# Rapid-Ride | Hanoi, Vietnam ðŸ‡»ðŸ‡³

Rapid-Ride is a simulation framework designed to model and visualize traffic systems, pedestrian dynamics, and environmental impacts like pollution. this project was developed while I studied in [VinUniversity](https://vinuni.edu.vn/). I worked under Professor Nguyen Ngoc Doanh who works with Digital Twin Technology to simulate some of the impacts of vehicles and traffic patterns within his city Hanoi. I wanted to learn and definetly did after the summer. Feel free to take a look at the code, it was coded in GAML. It was hard for me to get the syntax at first but it's like Java and C++, but so glad to learn how to make simualtion models!  

# Features
**Traffic Flow Modeling**: Simulates vehicle density and traffic dynamics on roads.

**Pedestrian Dynamics**: Adds pedestrian behavior into the urban simulation.

**Pollution Simulation**: Models how traffic contributes to air pollution.

**Experiment Framework**: Runs combined experiments with all models integrated for analysis.

# Getting Started

**Download GAMA Platform:** [Here](https://gama-platform.org/download)

**Running the Simulation**

- **Open the GAMA platform**

- **Load the desired .gaml file**

- **Configure the parameters as needed** 

- **Run the simulation and observe the results**
